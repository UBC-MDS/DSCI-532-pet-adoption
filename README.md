## Motivation
For those looking to adopt a pet, it can be tedious work to look through adoption availability at different animal hospitals. This data visualization app allows users to look at pet avaialbility by age at different animal hospitals, while applying filters such as whether pets have health issues, the type of animal to adopt, and whether a pet is already in adoption process, hence might not be available for adoption.
